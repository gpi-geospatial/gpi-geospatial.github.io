**GPI (Geospatial for Positive Impact)** is a student-led initiative to display the many ways that digital geography can give us a better understanding of our world, and to improve it.

**What is Geospatial?**

Geospatial refers to data and information that is related to specific geographic locations on Earth. It encompasses the analysis, visualization, and interpretation of spatial data to understand patterns, relationships, and trends in various contexts, including environmental studies, urban planning, and resource management. Geospatial technologies, such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing, enable users to collect, manage, and analyze geographic information, leading to more informed decision-making.

**What is Remote Sensing?**

Remote Sensing is the science of acquiring information about an object or area from a distance, typically using satellites or aerial sensors. This technology captures data in various spectral bands, allowing for the analysis of land cover, vegetation, climate change, and natural disasters. Remote sensing provides critical insights into environmental monitoring, urban development, and resource management without direct physical contact with the subject being observed.

**What is GIS?**

Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are systems designed to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, manage, and present spatial or geographic data. GIS integrates various data formats, including maps, satellite imagery, and tabular data, to enable users to visualize and interpret relationships and patterns in their data. It is widely used in urban planning, environmental conservation, transportation, and many other fields, facilitating data-driven decision-making and problem-solving in a geographic context.
